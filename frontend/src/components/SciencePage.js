            <h2>The science behind Moodpath</h2>
            <p>Numerous studies have shown: Mobile apps can help detecting mental health disorders and increase well-being. Together with several well-known universities and high-level partners, we started our own research projects in order to validate and constantly improve our digital product Moodpath.</p>
            <h3>Moodpath is being developed and validated in collaboration with scientists</h3>
            <p>Moodpath is based on the concept of cognitive behavioral therapy and was developed with experienced therapists and doctors. Additionally, researchers from the fields of psychology and psychotherapy conduct clinical studies to continuously validate the app.</p>
